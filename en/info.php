                        Share A Ride is the first carpooling platform in Albania. It is created to improve transport in our country.
                        Knowing how bad, the transport in Albania is, how long people have to wait to travel to their destination
                        and the problems with the licences and the permissions of the drivers led us to create a service like this.

                        The driver offers a ride, where he decides the point of departure and destination and the date and time as well.
                        The driver can give information about his car such as the model, the number of seats he offers and the plate
                        number (others will not be able to see the plate number, unless the driver decides to make it public).
                        Then the driver decides on a price and adds it on the website.
                        If anyone is interested they can contact the driver per email or by sending him a message.

                        The passenger gives the point of departure, the destination and the date and time. If there are any questions
                        about the ride, the passenger can contact the driver and contact him by email or by sending him a message.
                        When the destination is reached the passenger pays the driver about the ride, the price of which decided
                        by the driver.
                        There is an option where the passenger and the driver rate and give useful comments about
                        the ride and/or each other.
